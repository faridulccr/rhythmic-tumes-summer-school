## :page_with_curl: **Some Guidelines:**

1. Do not waste much time on the website idea. Just spend 20-30 minutes deciding, find a sample website, and start working on it.
2. Do not waste much time finding the right image. You can always start with a simple idea. Make the website and then add different images.
3. Don't look at the overall task list. Just take one task at a time and do it. Once it's done, pick the next task. If you get stuck on a particular job, move on to the next lesson.
4. Stay calm, think before coding, and work sequentially. You will make it.
5. Be strategic about the electricity issue.
6. Use ChatGPT to generate JSON data. You can use chatGPT for other purposes as well.
